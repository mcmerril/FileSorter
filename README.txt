This program is an automatic file sorter. Some variables will need to be altered for your system.
Create two folder. The first folder will contain all the files that are to be sorted. The second
will contain the subfolders that you want your files sorted into.

Note: You will need to save your files in a particular name format that you can alter within the code but
currently stands as: "Class-Type".


Note: "os.environ.get('OriginalFolderPath')" refers to an environment variable that is a path to the target 
folder you want to sort into (end folder containing other folders) and "os.environ.get'TargetFolderPath')" refers
to an environment variable that is a path to the starting folder contaning unsorted files.

Note: One file type is not filtered.
